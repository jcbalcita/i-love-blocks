### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and displaying a Canvas board.  Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`.  Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.  Learn the basics of Canvas.  Goals for the day:

- Get a green bundle with `webpack`
- Learn enough `Canvas` to render an object to the `Canvas` element

**Day 2**: Dedicate this day to learning the Canvas API.  Set up the blocks module.

- Complete the `block.js` module (constructor, update functions)
- Render square blocks to the `Canvas`

**Day 3**:  Goals for the day:

- Complete the `bullets.js` module (constructor, update functions)
- Make the blocks 'hittable' and 'destroyable'

**Day 4**: Install the controls for the user to interact with the game.  Style the frontend, making it polished and professional.  Goals for the day:

- Create controls for game speed, stop, start, reset
- Have a styled `Canvas`, nice looking controls and title
